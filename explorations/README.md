# Explorations

This folder is a **sandbox** for experimental and exploratory work. All new ideas, prototypes, and research experiments go here first — never directly into production folders.

## How It Works

1. **Create a subfolder** for each exploration (e.g., `explorations/new-estimator/`)
2. **Work freely** — lower quality threshold (60/100) during exploration
3. **Decide:** graduate to production (80/100 required), keep exploring, or archive

## Rules

- See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for quality thresholds and the full workflow
- Exploration quality threshold: 60/100 (lower than the production 80/100)
- Reference guide: `.claude/rules/exploration-fast-track.md`
